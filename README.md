This repository contains the code developed by following the examples described on the excelent book "Test Driven Development: By Example" written by [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/kentbeck). It contains a minimal implementation of the xUnit framework in python. 

Please note that the code in this repository was used only for learning purposes. If you're looking for a production-ready unit testing framework for python applications, you may consider using the python's built-in unit test framework [PyUnit](http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) or another external framework like [nose](https://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/).

To run the code provided on this repository, just use a simple python interpreter:

    python xUnit.py
